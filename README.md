# Pygame-Chicken-or-Burger-
"Chicken or Burger" is a fast adaptation of the Space Invaders game with a pro-animal protection perspective. In this game, the player can move not only along the traditional x-axis but also along the y-axis, making the defense against hamburger attacks more dynamic. The player must rescue chicks as part of the gameplay.
